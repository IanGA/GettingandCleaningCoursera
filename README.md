Required for Assignment on Getting and Cleaning

The script will run assuming that all required files are loaded into the root directory

The basic flow is to first get all the data and the headings before merging the data sets.

Once a final data set is created I filter the columns to only include the mean and SD columns

The final part of the script is to create a new clean data set of only the mean of the mean and SD fields .( I guess we need to ignore that the mean of a mean or SD is pretty bad stats!)
